learning accessibility for web pages

This set of pages is my learning of accessibility in order to add text alternatives and other tools to assist disabled people more easily use the web.
It is very important in order to keep the internet free and full of many ideas that those with disabilities are able to still fully use and contribute.
There is no reason to miss out on increadible ideas and creativity by making something unusable for someone with a disability.
